It focuses solely on the process and output without performance metrics.\n","\n","2. **Process Execution Structure**  \n","   - **Code A**:\n","     - Defines a `run_process(url)` function that encapsulates the entire workflow (download, transcribe, summarize, and print results).\n","     - Uses a loop with `for index, url in enumerate(urls)` to process multiple URLs sequentially, with a header (e.g., `##### PROCESS STARTING (1/2) #####`).\n","   - **Code B**:\n","     - Executes the process inline for each URL separately without a dedicated function.\n","     - Repeats the full process manually for two examples (Example 1 and Example 2) without a loop or consolidated structure.\n","\n","3. **Number of URLs Processed**  \n","   - **Code A**: Processes a list of URLs (two in this case) dynamically using a loop.\n","   - **Code B**: Processes two URLs individually in separate code blocks, hardcoding the process for each.\n","\n","4. **Output Formatting**  \n","   - **Code A**:\n","     - Prints a detailed report including time metrics, transcript, summary, and statistics in a single formatted block per URL.\n","     - Uses consistent labels (e.g., \"Transcript\" and \"Summary\" in English in your example, though originally in Turkish).\n","   - **Code B**:\n","     - Prints results in smaller, separate blocks (transcript/summary first, then stats).\n","     - Uses Turkish labels (e.g., \"Transkript\" and \"Özet\") consistently throughout.\n","\n","5. **Comments**  \n","   - **Code A**: Includes Turkish comments (e.g., `# 1. Video'dan Ses İndirme`) to label each function.\n","   - **Code B**: Has a mix of English explanations in the notebook overview and Turkish comments in the code (e.g., `# 2. Transkripsiyon`), reflecting its Jupyter Notebook style with narrative text.\n","\n","6. **Execution Context**  \n","   - **Code A**: Appears as a standalone Python script designed for automation and reusability.\n","   - **Code B**: Written in a Jupyter Notebook (`youtube-summary.ipynb`), with step-by-step execution, outputs (e.g., download logs), and warnings (e.g., from Whisper about FP16/FP32) included inline.\n","\n","7. **Error Handling and Robustness**  \n","   - **Code A**: No explicit error handling, but its structured design (with functions and a loop) suggests a focus on reusability.\n","   - **Code B**: Also lacks error handling, but its notebook format implies it’s more exploratory, with outputs like warnings from libraries visible (e.g., `FP16 is not supported on CPU`).\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Summary of Comparison**\n","\n","- **Similarities**:  \n","  Both codes perform the same core tasks (download audio, transcribe, summarize, and show stats) using identical libraries and methods. The workflow and logic are fundamentally the same.\n","\n","- **Key Differences**:  \n","  - **Time Tracking**: Code A measures and reports processing times; Code B does not.\n","  - **Structure**: Code A is more modular with a `run_process` function and loop, while Code B is less structured, repeating the process manually for each URL.\n","  - **Automation**: Code A is designed for batch processing multiple URLs; Code B processes them individually.\n","  - **Presentation**: Code A consolidates output with time stats; Code B separates output blocks and includes notebook-style logs/warnings.\n","  - **Context**: Code A is a script; Code B is a notebook with explanatory text.\n","\n","In essence, **Code A builds on Code B** by adding time measurement, a more organized structure, and batch processing, making it more robust and automated. Code B, as a notebook, seems more like a prototype or educational example, while Code A refines it into a practical tool.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"9bQpKT6wKg8K"}}]}
