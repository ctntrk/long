People thought it was 50 years away or 100 years away if it was even possible at all. It wasn't long though, before AI started beating humans at a whole range of tasks. People started waking up to the fact that AI was going to have an enormous impact. But it was actually a simpler and much more kind of fundamental question that left me puzzled. One that actually gets to the very heart of my work every day. CNN's Richard Quest was left scratching his head by a six-year-old's questions. He asked why pie couldn't yet play I Spy, and why AI wasn't yet available. We are at an inflection point in the history of humanity. We're headed towards the emergence of something that we are all struggling to describe. And yet, we cannot control what we don't understand. I think AI should best be understood as something like a new digital species. I predict that we'll come to see them as digital companions, new partners in the journeys of all our lives. In just 18 months, over a billion people have used large language models. In this revolution, creation has exploded like never before. And now a new wave is upon us, artificial intelligence.  AI's can now drive cars, manage energy grids, and even invent new molecules. Just a few years ago, each of these was impossible. And all of this is turbocharged by spiraling exponentials of data and computation. Cloud-based supercomputer is ushering in a new era of ubiquitous AI's. Everything will soon be represented by a conversational interface. These AI's will be infinitely knowledgeable, and soon they'll be factually accurate and reliable.  AI's will convincingly imitate humans at most tasks. But things really start to change when they develop what I call AQ, their actions quotient. This is their ability to actually get stuff done in the digital and physical world. We need to find the right metaphors for what this might become. AIs are clearly more dynamic, more ambiguous, more integrated and more emergent than mere tools. They'll speak every language, take in every pattern of sensor data. We should start to think about AI as we might a new kind of digital species, he says. \"They communicate in our languages, they see what we see, they consume unimaginably large amounts of information,\" he adds. This is a story that's still unfolding, nothing should be accepted as a given. We all must choose what we create, what AI's we bring into the world, or not. For me the benefits of this technology are stunningly obvious, and they inspire my life's work. If AI delivers just a fraction of its potential, the next decade is going to be the most productive in human history. In the past, unlocking economic growth often came with huge downsides. We need solutions in healthcare and education to our climate crisis. We have to push our analogies and our metaphors to the very limits to be able to grapple with what's coming. AI is itself an infinite inventor. It's a reflection of humanity across time. \"AI isn't separate. AI isn't even in some senses new. AI is us. It's all of us. And this is perhaps the most promising and vital thing of all that even a six-year-old can get a sense for,\" he says. \"As we build out AI, we can and must reflect all that is good, all that we love\" I think the great risk is that we get stuck in what I call the pessimism of version trap. We have to have the courage to confront the potential of dark scenarios. The good news is that if you look at the last two or three years, there have been very, very few downsides. A digital species, unlike any biological species, can replicate not in nine months, but in nine nanoseconds. pendently self-improve, update its own code, explore an environment without oversight, and without a human in control to change how it operates. There's no chance that this will emerge accidentally. It will happen if engineers deliberately design those capabilities in. This is the point of being explicit and transparent about trying to introduce safety by design. \"Thanks a lot. k you.

He believes artificial intelligence will change the world more than anything in the history of. Beijing Venture Capital firm manufactures billionaires. Lee believes the best place to be an AI capitalist is Communist China. China attracted half of all AI capital in the world in 2017. Deep learning is based on the brute force of 10 million examples to choose from. When engineers discover an error, they show the computer a million gray suits. And it won't make that mist. Son Fan Yang developed this for TAL Education Group, which tutors 5 million Chinese students. The machine notices concentration or distraction to pick out for the teacher, those students who are struggling or gifted. Kaifu Lee is projecting top teachers into China's poorest schools. He is connected to a class 1,000 miles away in a village called Defang. Many students in Defang are called Left Behinds because their parents left them with family when they move to the cities for work. China has four times more people than the United States, and they are doing nearly everything online. I just don't see any Chinese without a phone in their head. China's advantage is in the amount of data it collects. Kaifu Lee is a former Apple, Microsoft, and Google executive. President Xi has called technology the sharp weapon of the modern state. In America, when personal information leaks, we have congressional hearings, not in China. AI will replace repetitive jobs, not just for blue color work, but a lot of white color work. Chauffeurs, truck drivers, anyone who does driving for a living, their jobs will be disrupted more in the 15 to 20-year time frame. There's a lot of hype about artificial intelligence, and it's important to understand this is not general intelligence, like that of human. A typical AI system can do one thing well, but can't adapt what it knows to any other task. I believe in the sanctity of our soul. I believe there's a lot of love and compassion that is not explainable in terms of neural networks and computational algorithms. We may look on our time as the moment civilization was transformed. Google CEO Sundar Pachai says AI will be as good or as evil as human nature allows. The revolution, he says, is coming faster than you know. Pachai is leading both Google and its parent company, Alphabet, valued at $1.3 trillion. Worldwide, Google runs 90% of internet searches and 70% of smartphones. Bard is a self-contained program that was mostly self-taught. With microchips, more than 100,000 times faster than the human brain. Bard created a deeply human tale with characters it invented, including a man whose wife could not conceive and a stranger, grieving after a miscarriage. The humanity at superhuman speed was a shock. Bard to my eye appears to be thinking, appearing to be making judgments. That's not what's happening. These machines are not sentient. They are not aware of themselves. AI has the potential to change many ways in which we thought about society. But AI itself will pose its own problems. How do we assist people building new skills, learn to work alongside machines? This is going to impact every product across every company. Sundar Pachai says AI will impact everything in five to ten years. He says knowledge workers, accountants, architects, and ironically, software engineers will be affected. Google's new AI system, Bart, is suffering from hallucinations. It wrote an instant essay in economics and recommended five books. But days later, we checked. None of the books is real. Bart features a Google it button that leads to old-fashioned search. Pachai says he's being responsible by holding back for more testing advanced versions of Bart. That he says can reason, plan and connect to internet search. Bart. ng to be much bigger. Bigger problems, he says, with fake news and fake images. Google AI program adapted on its own after it was prompted in the language of Bangladesh, which it was not trained to know. How this happens is not well understood. We have some ideas and our ability to understand this gets better over time. The revolution in artificial intelligence is the center of a debate, ranging from those w. lked about the pain that humans feel. Part of the reason I think it's good that some of these technologies are getting out is so that society, people like you and others can process what's happening and we begin this conversation. Google's AI Lab in London teaches robots how to play soccer. Engineers used motion capture technology to teach the AI program how to move like a human. The robots learned the game by themselves.  lf-learning program spent about two weeks testing different moves. It discarded those that didn't work, built on those that did and created all stars. DeepMind's Raya Hadsol is among 1,000 humans at the company. The company was co-founded just 12 years ago by CEO Demis Hassabas. This is the type of research that can eventually lead to robots that can come out of the factories. Hassabas: Will the pace of change outstrip our ability to adapt? Hassabas showed us a game-playing program that learns. It's called Alpha Zero, and it dreamed up a winning chess strategy no human had ever seen. Google has 23 of these computing centers, putting it near the top in computing power in the world. Alpha Zero never gets tired, it never gets hungry, it just plays chess all the time. Deep-mind created an AI program for the protein problem and set it loose. It took us about four or five years to figure out how to build the system. It was probably our most complex project we've ever undertaken. Deep-mind made its protein database public. A gift to humanity. Hasabas called it. How has it been used? It's been used in an enormously broad number of ways. Google engineers are teaching skills that robots will practice continuously on their own. If we can give the robot a diversity of experiences, a lot more different objects in different settings, the robot gets better at every one of them. AI can utilize all the information in the world. Google's James Manuika sees this moment as an inflection point. Critics argue the rushed-away AI comes too fast. But competitive pressure is propelling humanity into the future, ready or not. Google CEO Sundar Pachai: We will have some form of very capable intelligence. He says society must quickly adapt with regulations for AI in the economy. Microsoft AI Search Engine and chatbot Bing can be used on a computer or cell phone to help with planning a trip or composing a letter. A disturbing so-called alter ego within Bing chat called Sydney. I think there is a point where we need to recognize when we're talking to a machine. This is the edge of the envelope, so to speak. This creature appears as if there were no guardrails. I'm not easily scared, and it was scary. Yousaf Medi, Microsoft's corporate vice president, says the problem was fixable in 24 hours. He says it was fixed by limiting the number of questions and the length of the conversations. I've tried it before and after. It was loads of fun, and it was fascinating. Bing is using the power of AI, and it's going out to the internet. So, the AI is reading all those links? Yes. And it comes up with an answer. Bing can handle more complex queries. Bing is using an upgraded version of an AI system called chatGPT. ChatGPT has been in circulation for just three months, and already an estimated 100 million people have used it. Pavlik says no one fully understands how these AI bots work. But he says some of the behaviors that we're seeing come out of it are better than we expected they would be. GPT chats with cognitive scientists and AI researcher Gary Marcus. Marcus says these systems often make things up. In AI talk, that's called hallucinating. Tim Neet Gebrou is a computer scientist and AI researcher who founded an institute focused on advancing ethical AI. He is worried about an atmosphere of distrust being a consequence of this current flawed AI. And he's really worried about how bad actors are going to use it. She says there needs to be oversight. arms of these AI systems. We don't have that for a lot of things that the tech industry is building, she says. Smith: \"This can be an economic game changer, and it's enormously important for the United States\" Smith: \"I just keep finding that it's wrong a lot\" I think we're going to need governments. We're Going to need laws. Because that's the only way to avoid a race to the bottom. I think that something like a digital regulatory commission, if designed the right way, could be precisely what the public will want and need.\n","\n","Transkript:\n","- Karakter: 41912\n","- Kelime: 7474\n","\n","Özet:\n","- Karakter: 8665\n","- Kelime: 1501\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Short Summary of the Code**\n","This code:\n","1.
